# B40 Healthcare Accessibility in Malaysia

## Overview
This project analyzes the distribution of clinics aimed at B40 families in Malaysia. By grouping clinics by state, the project seeks to identify which regions have the highest concentration of these healthcare services. Additionally, the study correlates the data with demographic factors and the relative wealth index of each state to assess healthcare accessibility.

## Objectives
- Map the distribution of clinics for B40 families across different Malaysian states.
- Analyze the correlation between healthcare access and demographic variables.
